# Project Overview

This project, written in Sass, offers a fully responsive design that adapts seamlessly to various devices, providing an optimal viewing experience up to 320px width.

### Features:

- **Responsive Design:** Utilizing the power of Flexbox, the layout dynamically adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing presentation.

- **Cross-browser Compatibility:** While Flexbox is employed for modern browsers, it's important to note that older browsers may not fully support its features, leading to potential layout differences.

- **Prefix Handling:** The project gracefully addresses browser inconsistencies by utilizing the appropriate vendor prefixes, ensuring compatibility across different environments. Notably, the `mask-image` and `mask-size` properties are implemented with consideration for varied browser support.

- **Enhanced Visuals:** Elevate the user experience with captivating animations that bring a touch of dynamism to the project.
