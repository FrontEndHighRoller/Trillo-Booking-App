## 👀 Why This Project Stands Out

- Fully responsive down to **320px device width**
- Advanced CSS architecture and styling
- Complex layout using **Flexbox**
- Demonstrates understanding of **scalable CSS design**
- Production-style setup with `package.json` and minified CSS

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic and structured markup  
- **CSS3 (Advanced)** – Flexbox, variables, animations, media queries  
- **Google Fonts** – Open Sans  
- **SVG Icons** – SVG sprite technique  
- **NPM** – Project configuration & dependency management  

---

## ✨ Features

- Modern hotel booking dashboard UI

- Sidebar navigation with active states  
- Ratings, reviews, and gallery sections  
- CSS variables for theme consistency  
- Minified CSS for optimized performance

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Writing **scalable and maintainable CSS**
- Using **CSS custom properties (variables)**
- Building complex layouts with **Flexbox**
- Implementing **responsive design principles**
- Using **SVG sprites** for performance
